# mashable-page

This repository intends to replicate the nav bar of https://mashable.com/ as a practice of the tools and technologies of the "put name of the course here"

Steps to run

1. Clone the project.

2. Run `npm install` on the root of the project to install the dependencies.

3. Run `npm install -g parcel-bundler` or `yarn global add parcel-bundler` depending on what package manager you have installed on your machine.

4. After the installation, run `parcel index.html` oh the command line. This should create the local host of the project and create the dist folder on the root of the project.

6. Open the local host link on chrome, firefox, or safari.
