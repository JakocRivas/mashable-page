# mashable-page

This repository intends to replicate the navbar of https://mashable.com/ as practice

Steps to run

1. Clone the project.

2. Run `npm install` on the root of the project to install the dependencies.

3. Run `npm install -g parcel-bundler` or `yarn global add parcel-bundler` depending on what package manager you have installed on your machine.

4. After the installation, run `parcel index.html` oh the command line. This should create the localhost of the project and create the dist folder on the root of the project.
   (I will install it directly on the project later so the dependency for parcel should be installed with npm install, more on that here: `https://parceljs.org/`).

5. The newly created localhost should be `http://localhost:1234/` by default.

6. Open the localhost link on chrome, firefox, or safari.
